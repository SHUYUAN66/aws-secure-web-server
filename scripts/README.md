# Scripts

This folder contains scripts used for setup, hardening, and basic operations.

## Planned scripts

* `setup_nginx.sh` — install and start Nginx
* `hardening_ssh.sh` — disable root login, enforce key-based auth
* `log_review.sh` — basic log review (can be scheduled with cron)

> Note: Scripts should avoid hardcoding secrets and should include usage instructions at the top.
